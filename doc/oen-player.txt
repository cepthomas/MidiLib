For programmers only
This program can be run from a bat file in several ways. The command is:

javaw -jar <the path to>/MIDIandStylePlayer.jar parameter1 parameter2 parameter3 parameter4

parameter1 (optional): the name of a file to open. If the file name has spaces, the file name must be in quotes. 
parameter2 (optional, requires parameter1): play 
parameter3 (optional, requires parameter1 and parameter2): part:style_section:loop number 
parameter4 (optional, requires parameter1 and parameter2): hidden

If "<the path to>" has spaces, the entire jar file name must be in quotes.

Sample command: 
javaw -jar "C:/my programs/MIDIandStylePlayer.jar" "C:/files/my style.sty" play part:MA:4 hidden

- If no parameter is defined: The program just opens 
- If parameter1 is defined: The program opens and loads the defined file 
- If parameter1 and parameter2 are defined: The program opens; loads the defined file and starts playing this file 
- If parameter1 and parameter2 and parameter3 are defined: The program opens; loads the defined file; starts playing the defined style section the loopnumber times; and closes automatically. 
- If parameter4 is defined, the User Interface is hidden and the program closes automatically.

parameter1 (the "file name") MUST be the first parameter; the order of the remaining parameters does not matter.

Style section format: 
MA = Main A; MB = Main B; MC = Main C; MD = Main D 
IA = Intro A; IB = Intro B; IC = Intro C; ID = Intro D 
EA = Ending A; EB = Ending B; EC = Ending C; ED = Ending D 
FAA = Fill In AA; FBB = Fill In BB; FCC = Fill In CC; FDD = Fill In DD 
FAB = Fill In AB; FBA = Fill In BA (breaks)

Associating a file type (e.g. ".sty") to this program:

1. Create a bat file (e.g. "MIDIandStylePlayer.bat") in Notepad with this command: javaw -jar "<the path to>/MIDIandStylePlayer.jar" %1

2. Convert this bat file to an executable file (".exe" extension) using a converter. Search Google to find a converter for your system. Give the converted file a name, e.g. "MIDIandStylePlayer.exe"

3. In Explorer, right click a file of the type (e.g. ".sty") you want to associate to this program.

4. Select "Open with"; find the executable "MIDIandStylePlayer.exe" at your computer; and select this.

5. If you want to associate more file types to this program, repeat step 3 and 4.

Settings Files Location
Settings files are saved in a subfolder (named jososoft) to the Users Application Data Folder.

In newer Windows versions you will find the Settings Files in folder:
C:\Users\<user>\AppData\Roaming\jososoft

Settings Files Editing
It is NOT recommended to edit the Settings Files manually.

However, you can edit files with ini and dat extensions in Note Pad.

When saving the edited file make sure to save it in the right name by selecting All Files when saving. Otherwise you wil get a file with double extension, e.g. 'programdata.ini.txt'.

Files with other extensions that the above mentioned are not manually editable.

If Settings Files are deleted the program will automatically create new files. Notice that these new Settings Files will hold default values.

Notice that the Settings Files format is not documented; and I cannot make any troubleshooting if the Settings Files has been edited manually.
